* Game Object 
** User Interface
   Perhaps UI can also be a component, alongside others like, in the case of Asteroids, Player and Asteroid objects. It does seem to have common processes:

   - Initialize
   - Update
   - Render
   - Process Input
** Game Pieces, Game Objects
   Pieces like Asteroids and Player would be of a common category further down. So perhaps there would be a hierarchy, in a way DrawingElement objects also belong. So, roughly, it would look kind of like,

   GameObject
