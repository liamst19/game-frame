#+Title: Notes on Game-Frame projects

* TODO Fix UI: Clock Display
  
  The minutes are not showing up, seconds going beyond 60.
  
* TODO Merge this frame with Asteroid project
* TODO Add tests
  I probably should have added them before anything else

* TODO Add components to GameObject
  - Physics
  - Drawing
  - Input
  - Collision
* TTF_RenderText_Blended_Wrapped
  
  For long texts, you can set a wraplength parameter.

  TTF_RenderText_Blended_Wrapped(
        font: PTTF_Font; 
        text: PAnsiChar; 
        fg: TSDL_Color; 
        wrapLength: UInt32): PSDL_Surface

* TODO Render Glyphs to Texture, use it for text rendering

  [[https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/docs/SDL_ttf_54.html][TTF_RenderGlyph_Blended]] 

* TODO Drawing::Image
* TODO Experiment: SDL_RenderDrawLine on a SDL_Surface, then do SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface.

  This way we won't have to make expensive drawings each iteration and instead impose pre-made textures. The idea is for the =Drawing= object to possess and call the renderer, which would create the =SDL_Surface= and draw all the =DrawingElement= objects in that single surface. Upon completion of the drawing the renderer will call [[https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface][SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface]].

* TODO UI::Framerate Ticker
* DONE Drawing::Polygon
* DONE Fix UI::Clock display
  It should appear like:  00:00:00
