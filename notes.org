#+Title: Notes on Game-Frame projects

* TODO Animation
  
  Figure out a way to incorporate animation using the =Drawing= classes.
  My rough guess for an =Animation= class is:
    - It would inherit =Drawing=
    - It would contain a collection of =Drawing= objects, each representing a frame, paired with the timing at which the object will be rendererd.
    - =render()= will keep track of time as it renders each =Drawing= frame.
    - Another option is for =Animation= to contain a duration property, which would be divided by the size of =Drawing= vector.

* TODO Drawing class: width, height, center

  The =Drawing= class should calculate the minimum and maximum positions of all the elements it contains. It should also possess a center position, around which it will be rotated.

  The center position could also inform SDL, when =SDL_Texture= is to be used, in determining =SDL_Rect= for the target =SDL_Surface= object, and for rendering texture using the =SDL_CopyEx= method.

* TODO Merge this frame with Asteroid project
* TODO Add tests
  I probably should have added them before anything else

* TODO Render Glyphs to Texture, use it for text rendering

  [[https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/docs/SDL_ttf_54.html][TTF_RenderGlyph_Blended]] 
* TODO Experiment: Render Drawing on a SDL_Surface, then do SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface.

  This way we won't have to make expensive drawings each iteration and instead impose pre-made textures. The idea is for the =Drawing= object to possess and call the renderer, which would create the =SDL_Surface= and draw all the =DrawingElement= objects in that single surface. Upon completion of the drawing the renderer will call [[https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface][SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface]].
* TTF_RenderText_Blended_Wrapped
  
  For long texts, you can set a wraplength parameter.

  TTF_RenderText_Blended_Wrapped(
        font: PTTF_Font; 
        text: PAnsiChar; 
        fg: TSDL_Color; 
        wrapLength: UInt32): PSDL_Surface

* DONE Add components to GameObject
  - Physics
  - Drawing
  - Input
  - Collision

* DONE UI::Framerate Ticker
* DONE Drawing::Image
* DONE Drawing::Polygon
* DONE Fix UI: Clock Display
  
  The minutes are not showing up, seconds going beyond 60.

* DONE Fix UI::Clock Display
  
  It should appear like:  00:00:00
